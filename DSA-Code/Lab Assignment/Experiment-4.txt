Experiment 4 (Dynamic Memory Allocation and File Operations)


      I.         
WAP to store a character string in a block
of memory space and then modify the same to store a larger string.


    II.         
Implement 2D Matrix multiplication by
creating two matrix using dynamic memory allocation.


  III.         
WAP to store an information in array of
structure, dynamically, and also give a function to display the current
information. The program should give user a choice for inserting a data or to
display the current data. Implement the program for Student structures
(contains student_name, student_roll_no, total_marks).


  IV.         
Implement the above program for Employee
structures (contains employee_name, emp_no, emp_salary).


    V.         
Implement the above program for Faculty
structures (contains faculty_name, faculty_ID, subject_codes, class_names).


  VI.         
WAP to Create a new file, Open an existing
file, read the file to search a given word, write into the file and close the
file.
